#Research topic: Pickle Module
#Code Version 7.7
#Description: Pickled model as a file using joblib: Joblib is the replacement of pickle as it is more efficent on #objects that carry large numpy arrays. These functions also accept file-like object instead of filenames.


joblib.dump to serialize an object hierarchy
joblib.load to deserialize a data stream

#Save to pickled file using joblib â€“

from sklearn.externals import joblib 

# Save the model as a pickle in a file 
joblib.dump(knn, 'filename.pkl') 

# Load the model from the file 
knn_from_joblib = joblib.load('filename.pkl') 

# Use the loaded model to make predictions 
knn_from_joblib.predict(X_test)
