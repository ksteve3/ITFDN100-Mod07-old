	--> README.txt (File) 
		--> PM_Featured_Scripts (fldr)

The code snippets located in the PM_Featured_Scripts folder are featured in the in the Assignment07.docx file, ITFDN100 (Foundations of Python Programming),   as well as on the linked GitHub Webpage, titled "Exception Handling & Pickling in PY", (Assignment07). These snippets were created and tested while shadowing the instruction of online video tutorials relating to the topic of Exception Handling in Python 3.

Links to the resources used to recreate these snippets can be found on my ksteve3/ITFDN100-Mod07/ GitHub repository, located in the Assignment07.docx file(../ITFnd100-Mod07/Assignment07/Assignment07.docx) or on the repositories webpage (../ITFnd100-Mod07/Assignment07/Webpage.md). 
I also included a link to a GoogleSheets list of alternative resources related to the same Python Programming topics mentioned in this repository that I found along the way and may be of use for other Python Beginners and troubleshooters. This can be found in the Assignment07.docx file under sources.
